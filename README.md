# Quantumness in Reservoir Computing

Welcome to the github repo designated to the paper "Correlations Between Quantumness and Learning Performance in Reservoir
Computing with a Single Oscillator," a joint work with Dr. Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, and Prof. Christoph Simon. Briefly, our work examines the effects of quantumness in a reservoir computing task. The reservoir is taken to be a simple Kerr oscillator, and the main task is the prediction of Mackey-Glass time-series. We demonstrate that quantumness could indeed be a valuable resource in the learning process. See [the paper](https://google.com) for the details.

You can find the codes that have generated the figures in the corresponding folders.

1. In Figure 2 folder, you can find the main learnning codes, for different tasks, such as learning a Mackey-Glass or a Rossler dynamics.
