# Quantumness in Reservoir Computing

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to the paper entitled "Correlations Between Quantumness and Learning Performance in Reservoir Computing with a Single Oscillator." This paper was a collaborative effort between myself, [Dr. Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi](https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/phas/profiles/1-9226636), and [Prof. Christoph Simon](https://science.ucalgary.ca/physics-astronomy/contacts/christoph-simon) from the University of Calgary.

We have made the decision to share the code used in our research with you. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this repository.

To give you a brief overview of our work, we investigate the impact of quantumness in a reservoir computing task. Our reservoir consists of a simple Kerr oscillator, and we focus on predicting Mackey-Glass time-series. Our results suggest that quantumness could be a valuable resource in the learning process. For more details, please refer to [the paper](https://google.com).

## Learning Performance
In Figure 2 folder, you can find the main learnning codes, for different tasks, such as learning a Mackey-Glass or a Rossler dynamics. Below is the training result for the Mackey-Glass.
