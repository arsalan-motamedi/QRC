# Quantumness in Reservoir Computing

Welcome to the github repo designated to the paper "Correlations Between Quantumness and Learning Performance in Reservoir
Computing with a Single Oscillator," a joint work with [Dr. Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi](https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/phas/profiles/1-9226636), and [Prof. Christoph Simon](https://science.ucalgary.ca/physics-astronomy/contacts/christoph-simon). We chose here to share the codes of our paper with you. Please feel free to reach out about the content of this repo.

As a quick introduction to our work, we examine the effects of quantumness in a reservoir computing task. The reservoir is taken to be a simple Kerr oscillator, and the main task is the prediction of Mackey-Glass time-series. We demonstrate that quantumness could indeed be a valuable resource in the learning process. See [the paper](https://google.com) for details.

1. In Figure 2 folder, you can find the main learnning codes, for different tasks, such as learning a Mackey-Glass or a Rossler dynamics.
