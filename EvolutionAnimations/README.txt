This folder includes animations regarding the evolution of the Wigner functions
throughout the process for different initial states.

We consider the following initial states:
Displaced ket 6
coherent state (i.e., displaced ket 0)
Squeezed state

Also, we show the evolution of the coherent state under dephasing noise.
